# Questions

## What's `stdint.h`?

stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library section 7.18 to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros

## What's the point of using `uint8_t`, `uint32_t`, `int32_t`, and `uint16_t` in a program?

These functions are a cross-platform implementation of a standard data type. uint8_t is an unsigned int of 8 bits, uint32_t is an unsigned long long, int32_t is a signed long long, and a uint16_t is an unsigned 16 bit int.

## How many bytes is a `BYTE`, a `DWORD`, a `LONG`, and a `WORD`, respectively?

A BYTE is an 8-bit unsigned value that corresponds to a single octet in a network protocol.

A DWORD is a 32-bit unsigned integer (range: 0 through 4294967295 decimal). Because a DWORD is unsigned, its first bit (Most Significant Bit (MSB)) is not reserved for signing.

A LONG is a 32-bit signed integer, in twos-complement format (range: â€“2147483648 through 2147483647 decimal). The first bit (Most Significant Bit (MSB)) is the signing bit.

A WORD is a 16-bit unsigned integer (range: 0 through 65535 decimal). Because a WORD is unsigned, its first bit (Most Significant Bit (MSB)) is not reserved for signing.

## What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

The first two bytes specify the file is a bitmap with the words "BM", or the hex 0x4D42 .

## What's the difference between `bfSize` and `biSize`?

bfSize describes the entire file size in bytes, whereas biSize is the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER in bytes.

## What does it mean if `biHeight` is negative?

Negative biHeight means the bitmap is is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

## What field in `BITMAPINFOHEADER` specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

biBitCount

## Why might `fopen` return `NULL` in `copy.c`?

fopen will return null if it cannot open the file. This can happen if there is not enough memory or the file cannot be found.

## Why is the third argument to `fread` always `1` in our code?

The third argument determines the number of elements fread will read. So this argument is always 1 because we are always reading one file.

## What value does `copy.c` assign to `padding` if `bi.biWidth` is `3`?

1

## What does `fseek` do?

fseek moves the file position indicator.

## What is `SEEK_CUR`?

SEEK_CUR is an option used in fseek to set the offset relative to the current pointer position.
